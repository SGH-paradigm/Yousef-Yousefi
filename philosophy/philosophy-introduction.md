# Philosophy Introduction

Philosophy is the lens through which science first came into focus. It is the realm of first principles, causality, abstraction, and thought experiments. In this section, we introduce the philosophical framework that informs the unification of all fields presented in this book.

We discuss critical themes such as:
- The role of abstraction and generalization
- Ontological and epistemological assumptions
- The importance of logic and language
- How philosophical reasoning leads to scientific modeling

This introduction lays the groundwork for the deeper philosophical chapters that follow.
