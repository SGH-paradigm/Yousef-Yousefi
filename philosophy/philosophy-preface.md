# Philosophy Preface

This section explores the philosophical foundations that underpin the Science Generalization Hypothesis (SGH). Philosophy serves as both the origin and guiding principle of scientific inquiry. Here, we investigate the nature of knowledge, existence, logic, and the reasoning that enables a unified scientific worldview.

The preface provides context for the philosophical motivations behind the rest of the book and prepares the reader for a conceptual journey from metaphysical assumptions to formalized scientific structures.
