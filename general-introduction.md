# General Introduction

Welcome to my scientific project and lifelong work on the **generalization and unification of scientific knowledge** across mathematics, physics, and philosophy.

This work introduces a set of innovative theories and frameworks, including:
- **Scale-dependent dimensionality**: Understanding spacetime and fields as scale-dependent entities.
- **Prime numbers as entangled states**: A novel view connecting number theory and quantum entanglement.
- **3D Cartesian systems based on Pauli matrices**: Reformulating quantum mechanics geometrically.
- **Unified fields and forces**: Deriving natural unification from effective dimensional changes.

Each idea is part of a coherent structure aiming to reveal the hidden simplicity behind nature's complexity.

> âœ¨ The website is organized into Philosophy, Mathematics, Physics, and Results sections for a systematic presentation.
