# General Introduction

Welcome to my scientific project and lifelong work on the **generalization and unification of scientific knowledge** across mathematics, physics, and philosophy.

This project introduces several groundbreaking theories and frameworks:

- **Scale-dependent dimensionality**: Understanding how the effective dimensionality of spacetime changes with scale, leading to a natural explanation of field unification.
- **Prime numbers as entangled states**: A revolutionary perspective connecting number theory with quantum entanglement concepts.
- **3D Cartesian coordinate systems based on Pauli matrices**: A new approach to quantum mechanics using geometric structures.
- **Unified fields and forces**: Revealing the deeper unity of fundamental interactions through dimensional analysis.

Each idea is part of a coherent framework aiming to simplify and unify the description of nature at all scales.

## 📚 Organization of the Work

The full work is organized into the following major sections:

- **Opening Section**: General introduction and Table of Contents.
- **Philosophy Section**: Foundational philosophical motivations behind the theories.
- **Mathematics Section**: Mathematical innovations and formal structures.
- **Physics Section**: Physical applications, reformulations, and predictions.
- **Results Section**: Summaries, major results, conclusions, and future directions.

Each section is systematically divided into chapters and subchapters for clear navigation.
