# Mathematics Preface

This section explores the mathematical foundations that support the unified scientific hypothesis proposed in this work.

It serves as a preparatory guide to the mathematical principles, structures, and logic that underlie the generalization and unification efforts across disciplines. The focus will range from basic formal systems to advanced abstract constructions that link with physical phenomena and philosophical interpretations.

Each chapter builds progressively and includes conceptual developments intended for a broad interdisciplinary audience. You are encouraged to keep both mathematical rigor and scientific intuition in balance while reading.
