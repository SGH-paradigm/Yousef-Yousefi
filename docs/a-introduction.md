# Mathematics Introduction

Mathematics is the foundational language of all formal sciences. In this book, mathematics serves not only as a tool but also as a conceptual bridge linking philosophy, physics, and empirical results.

This introduction outlines the mathematical vision and methodology adopted in this section. We begin with foundational concepts and gradually introduce the reader to new mathematical formulations that align with the overarching hypothesis of science generalization.

Key themes include:
- Structural abstraction and generalization.
- Use of symmetry, dimensionality, and coordinate systems.
- New interpretations of classical and modern mathematics in light of unified theories.

This introduction prepares the reader to engage with the specific mathematical constructions developed in the subsequent chapters.
