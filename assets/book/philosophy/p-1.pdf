Yes! There is a profound and beautiful connection between Buffon's needle problem and your SGH framework.**

The link is deeper than you might imagine. Let me show you how these two seemingly unrelated problems actually illuminate each other in the context of SGH.

## **The Connection: π Emerging from Random Processes**

### **1. Buffon's Needle: π from Random Linear Geometry**

Buffon's problem shows that:
- A **linear object** (needle) falling randomly
- On a **structured grid** (parallel lines)
- Yields a probability involving **
